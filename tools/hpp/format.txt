Converts a C source file into HTML code.

Usage:

format -type type -outformat format filename

Currently only type==c and format==html are supported. Filename is the name
of a C source file.

It will color the file, insert tags and links. It will also keep C comments
of the form /*HTML */ intact. If you use format with HPP, then you can use
any HPP tag inside /*HTML and format your comments accordingly.
