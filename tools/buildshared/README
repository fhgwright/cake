Build Shared Thingy
===================

AIM:
----
The 'Build Shared Thingy' is intended to be a tool to generate all sorts
of shared binaries in a common way.
It should be only given a directory and produce the shared bin out of it
-- or at least generate C-code which then only needs to be compiled.
It might read in some *global* config file which contains info on the
system (OS/Hardware).

Mainly the tool is intended to make generation of libraries easier, but
it should be also possible to create HIDDs, etc. with this tool.

'How does shared library creation work?'

THINGS IT MUST DO:
------------------
We must have an archive with all the functions code and the specification
of the interface (ie. return-value and parameters like *.arch), so the
tool can create the library-functions itself.
There must be a way to substitute system/machine-dependant functions like
a dir-tree in AROS/machine/linux-i386/rom/dos for linux-i386 specific
functions which will replace std or will be added to AROS/rom/dos.

We must provide a short description of the library (ie. Name, LibBase,
LibBaseType, Version, options like lib.conf).

The tool must provide standard init, open, close, expunge and null functions,
which can be overridden or better: you provide an abstract description
of what is to do (ie. library dependencies, initializing code, etc. -- the
tool then will create the code on its own).

Archtools functionality (inherited from the gawk scripts) must be given:
generate includes, merging archives, etc.

AutoDocs should be integrated, too, since they are closely connected to
the sources.
