Short: AROS - Amiga Replacement OS
Author:   Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de) and many others
Uploader: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de)
Version:  1.10
Type:	  misc/emu

New this time:
- Bugfixes
- Worked on docs
- Many (50+) new functions in c.lib and amiga.lib
- Big endian IO functions in aros.library
- Amiga native and Linux/m68k versions. Amiga is still alpha.
- A *pre* alpha of VBCC with i386 support. This is only loosely
	connected to AROS. See the README in the directory
	\filename{AROS/compiler/vbcc/}.
- iffparse.library completed
- Exec 90% completed, DOS 50% completed, Graphics 15%, Intuition 25%.
    All in all 30% of the whole work is completed.
- Uses now shares libs on Unix to make it smaller

HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

There are two archives:

    AROSdev-$x.$y.lha
    AROS-$a-$b-$x.$y.lha

$x is the major and $y is the minor release, $a is the system and $b is
the CPU this archive is for, ie.

    AROS-linux-i386-1.10b.lha

Is the binary archive for linux with Intel CPU (386 and above). The version is
1.10 and it's a beta.

If you are not involved with developing AROS but want to try it out or
(even better) want to write apps for AROS, get the binary archive. It
contains a ready-to-use copy of all binaries for AROS (not that there
were many, yet ... :-). Unpack the archive, cd into AROS and run
the arosshell (NOTE: For some systeme, there are shared versions of the
libs to save disk space. On these systems, you must tell the loader to
look into AROS/lib for additional libs. On linux, do "export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (without the "")).

Now you will get a prompt reading "Workbench:> ". Now type "dir all" and
press return and doesn't it look familiar (There will be lots of debugging
output which you can safely ignore. It will go away in the next versions) ?
Try "demowin" to see what our intuition.library and graphics.library can
do. Have you tried "sift" ? This is the AROS version of sift.c which is in
the RKRMs. We just copied and compiled it and it works ! If you want to try
it, copy any IFF file into the AROS directory and call sift with the
name of that file. It will print you the contents of the file using
iffparse.library !
