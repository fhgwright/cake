arosboot 41.8
    Fixed bug that could cause reset vector corruption (mementry for the
    KickTagPtr was 4 bytes short).

arosboot 41.7

    Do all file operations relative to PROGDIR:. This applies to the config
    file itself as well as to modules. This removes the need to CD into the
    directory where arosboot lives before running arosboot.

arosboot 41.6

    New way to handle config files and selective patching. More info
    about this in the doc and example config file. Renamed to arosboot.

boot 41.5

    Back out 41.4 change of falling back to MEMF_LOCAL. It turned out to worsen
    the situation when using FastExec with the "local" option. Still have the
    "-l" option in boot to force AROS to MEMF_LOCAL.

boot 41.4

    No longer fall back to MEMF_CHIP on kick V37, but to MEMF_LOCAL. This may
    also benefit FastExec users.

boot 41.3

    Fail if option not recognized (e.g. "boot 0x" instead of "boot -x").
