0001
- parse fixed file and sort strings into tree structure
- printf() the structure as "simulation" of execution

0002
- free malloc'ed memory after successfully executing string

0003
- split one sourcefile into multiple included into main file
- removed debug information on parsing

0004
- always check for (malloc()!=NULL) else exit(-1)
- use "#warning FIXME: blah" to mark bugs/missing sections/hacks
- introduced files BUGS and ChangeLog

0005
- now the sources compile into modules
- start interpreting commands

0006
- fixed problem that startup.o has to be the first objectfile
- added int *intval; to struct ScriptArg
- support for integers in script (bin,dec,hex)

0007
- added commands.h which contains the strings of known commands
- added texts.h which contains the default values of some variables

0008
- moved content of commands.h into execute.h and deleted commands.h :-(

0009
- added support for LINUX only compilation
  (for testing issues only - will go away soon)
- added preliminary code for some functions (abort,exit,transcript)

0010
- changed installation dir to SYS:Utilities and metatarget to utilities
- added support for variable storage and restorage (untested!!!)
- added first test code for variable lists

0011
- added support for set command
- fixed bug that ->parent has not been set
- fixed bug in dynamic variable list creation

0012
- prepared main() for ReadArgs()
- realloc() can be used as malloc() -- shortenes code ;-)
- added collection of arguments for _STRING ( "..." ... ) to pass
  to RawDoFmt()
- fixed a bug which caused parse_script() to have an empty ScriptArg at
  end of lists, now if RBRACK is detected the last element is deleted
  and pointers made valid (except if it would be the one and only!!!
  In this case ->parent->cmd has to be set to NULL as well etc.
  (Maybe we should terminate if braces are empty?) )
- added missing "@" for preset variables

0014
- left out previous version due to superstition ;-)
- fixed bug which allocated one byte too less 8-|
  (hope this fixes previous problems...), marked those bugs as fixed
- symbols now may be finished with a semicolon
- added some cleanup routines
- split variable specific stuff into own object file variables.c
- added function prototypes to *.c
- added stripping of quotes in _STRING (plus freeing temporary spaces
  for stripped strings)

0015
- commands are now caseinsensitive
- supplied debugging code for "working" "welcome" and "complete"
- reduced code in variables.c
- supplied final code for "transcript [string|var|cmd]..."
- now we execute commands, too, where values should be (we always get
  return values)
- removed obsolete testing code

0016
- added demo/test script for written functions test.script_simple
- added "+" and "and" handling
- added function for stripping quotes off a string
  ( to be more precise: strip off first and last chararcter )
- installer didn't recognize negative numbers :-( Fixed.

0017
- First try with RawDoFmt() -- not very successful :-(

0018
- Added code for "bitand" "bitor" "bitxor" "/" "-" "or" "xor" "=" "<" "<="
  ">" ">=" "<>" (integrated into "and" )
- Implemented "*" "not" "bitnot" "strlen" "select" "if"
- minor optimizations

0019
- added cleanup() before each exit(-1);
- added support for number-strings in arithmetic functions where missing
- implemented "cat"
- fixed bug in "select" and return (NULL|0) if n<=0 or n>number of items
- fixed bug in variable storage (if text == NULL )
- added return value for blocks
- implemented "while" "until"

0020
- RawDoFmt() works now!
- added "shiftleft" and "shiftrght" to "and"
- Implemented "in"
- Optimized item to integer conversion

0021
- added error.h with structs/defines on error Handling
- added procedure.c with functions on user-defined procedures
- added blank template for "_PROCEDURE" keyword:
  procedures are parsed before script execution,
  redefinition of procedures is not allowed
- fixed bug where I used sizeof(string) instead of strlen(string)
- added missing commands/tags as empty templates to execute_script()
- fixed bug in RawDoFmt() with ints ;-)
- extended test.script_simple

0022
- added dynamic size support to RawDoFmt()
  ( needed quite some hacks :-( and works only up to 256k ;-)

0023
- added gui.c with functions for the gui
- added error handling for parsing file
- undefined variables now return (NULL|0) as value
- added "database" command -- needs computation of return values

0024
- added text-gui for user-level and abort requester
- added text-gui for "working" "complete" "abort"
- added function which collects all following arguments after executing
  cmd and converts intval to strings if arg is NULL ( you can specify a
  separating character )
  "abort" "cat" "exit" "welcome" "working" make use of this function
- reinitialized (freed/set to Null) return values collectively

0025
- added "substr" "user" "debug"
- started work on parameters
  . get_parameters() supports boolean parameters
  . "exit" understands (quiet)
  . string-only parameters get their strings read in
  . all other parameters get their values read in
