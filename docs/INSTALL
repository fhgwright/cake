Basic Installation of AROS-SOURCES
----------------------------------

1. Get the source tree.
	At the moment you have to be an AROS-developer to get the sources
	due to our status with Amiga Inc., which says that we must have a
	licence.
	As you can read this text, I assume that you already have the
	sources from the CVS server.
	To obtain a recent version, do a "cvs update -d", so you get all
	new files and directories.

2. Install the tree, say in "/usr/src" or anything apropriate.
	It is possible to build AROS in your main cvs-copy, as all
	generated files should be ignored by the CVS server, but I think
	it is better to leave your copy clean, if you can afford the disk
	space. (A complete compilation has approx. 5000 files! and ~20MB
	for -O2 optimized binaries)

3. Build all the necessary tools for compilation.
	Get all non-AROS tools,
	i.e. get a c-compiler (gcc recommended), binutils, gawk, etc.
	Now compile AROS' tools. Either run "setup" or:

	a) MetaMake, short mmake.
		cd AROS/tools/MetaMake
		./configure
		make
		make install
		cd ../..
		cp mmake.config.in $HOME/.mmake.config
		  (to install it global or if you only intend to start
		  mmake in the AROS directory)
		cp mmake.config.in mmake.config
		Now edit your mmake.config file to your needs:
		- uncomment and adjust "top /home/digulla/AROS", if you
		  want to compile from anywhereelse than the top dir.

	b) The Makefile-Generation tool, short genmf.
		cd AROS/tools/genmf
		make
		  (to install the binary, or to use the old gawk script,
		  edit mmake.config and comment out the other
		  "genmakefilescript"-line)

	c) The function-packer, cpak.
		This one should not be needed to be compiled first,
		because it will be generated "on the fly" (if needed),
		but just to mention it, because it is used:
		cd AROS/tools/cpak
		make

4. Run ./configure
	Use ./configure --help for all possible options.
	This will examine your system and create the necessary
	files for the build.

	That's it. And now for the most important step:

4. Compile your sources.
	If you have the .mmake.config in your $HOME dir, and adjusted
	the "top" variable in it, just call mmake, or if you haven't,
	call mmake in the topdir of AROS (e.g: /usr/src/AROS)

Now everything should compile well, and you binaries are placed in
AROS/bin/(os)-(cpu-type)/AROS.
If you have compiled AROS as an emulation, cd into this dir, start
arosshell and enjoy!
