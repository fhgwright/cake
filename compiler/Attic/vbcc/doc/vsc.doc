vsc - scheduler for vbcc (c) in 1997 by Volker Barthelmann


INTRODUCTION

    vsc is an instruction-scheduler which reorders the assembly output of 
    vbcc and tries to improve performance of the generated code by avoiding 
    pipeline stalls etc.

    Like the compiler vbcc it is split into a target independant and a
    target dependant part. However there may be code-generators for vbcc
    which do not have a corresponding scheduler.

    This document only deals with the target independant parts of vsc.
    Be sure to read all the documents for your machine.

    NOTE: This is a pre-alpha-release! Doesn't really work!


LEGAL

    vsc is (c) in 1997 by Volker Barthelmann. 
    vsc may be freely redistributed as long as no modifications are made
    and nothing is charged for it.
    Non-commercial usage of vsc is allowed without any restrictions.
    Commercial usage needs my written consent.

    Sending me money, gifts, postcards etc. would of course be very nice
    and may encourage further development of vsc, but is not legally or
    morally necessary to use vsc.


USAGE

    Usually vsc will be called by a frontend. However if you call it
    directly, it has to be done like this:

    vsc [options] input-file output-file

    The following options are supported:

    -quiet      Do not print the copyright notice.

    -debug=<n>  Set debug-level to <n>.


    Note that depending on the target vbcc may insert hints into the
    generated code to tell vsc what CPU to schedule for. Code
    scheduled for a certain CPU may run much slower on slightly different
    CPUs. Therefore it is especially important to specify the correct 
    target-CPU when compiling.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
