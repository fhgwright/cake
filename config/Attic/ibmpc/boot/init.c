    FUNCTION
	This is the main file in Native PC AROS. The main function is called
	by head.S file. All this code is in flat 32-bit mode.
	
	This file will make up the exec base, memory and other stuff. We don't
	need any malloc functions, because there is no OS yet. To be honest:
	while main is running Native PC AROS is the only OS on our PC.

	Be careful. You cant use any stdio. Only your own functions are
	acceptable at this moment!!
