boopsi/ - The BOOPSI system code. This is separated in order to use it
	during early startup before intuition.library has been initialised.

boot/ - Various boot time code. bootstraps, bootmenu etc...

devs/ - ROM devices, ie. devices which are not loaded from
	disk during runtime (eg. \filename{console.device}).

dos/ - \label{dos}The first library which is added to the OS by standard operations.
	Use this one as a starting point if you want to develop own
	libraries. Below is a list of interesting files.

	All other files are functions of the library with one function
	per file. Each file contains an AutoDoc-like header and some
	extra infos which are needed by the scripts. If possible each
	file should also contain a test which can be enabled with
	\shell{-DTEST}. See \filename{AROS/dos/filepart.c} for a good example.

exec/ - The source for the exec.library. This is no good starting point
	for own libraries since Exec is not initialized like other
	libraries and so some things are handled differently here.

	Exec relies on some files which are in \filename{$(KERNEL)/}.

graphics/ - Sourcecode for the \filename{graphics.library}. See
	\lref{dos/}{dos} for more information.

hidd/ - The system independant parts of the HIDD system.

intuition/ - Sourcecode for the \filename{intuition.library}. See
	\lref{dos/}{dos} for more information.

utility/ - Sourcecode for the \filename{utility.library}. See
	\lref{dos/}{dos} for more information.
