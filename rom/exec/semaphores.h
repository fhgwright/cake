    Node for a task waiting synchronously:
    Maybe this shouldn't have a struct Node as first element - but I want
    it to be compatible to Procure()'s struct SemaphoreMessage.
    This means that ln_Name contains the lock type (SM_EXCLUSIVE or
    SM_SHARED). And since ln_Type is NT_MESSAGE for semaphore messages
    waiting on the semaphore list it isn't free either. The only field
    left in the node is ln_Pri which contains the node type (see below).
