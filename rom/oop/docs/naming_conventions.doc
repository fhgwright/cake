This might not seem like that big a deal,
but IMHO its nice to have some standard way
of naming attrs an methods.

Method/attr offsets.

Currently method and attr offsets are constructed like
this:

method offs:
mo<interface>_<method name>  (eg. moTimer_Start)

attr offs:
ao<interface>_<attrname>  (eg. aoTimer_Elapsed)

or moHidd_GC_SetPixel and aoHidd_GC_FgPen


Class should be like this:
CLID_<system>_<class name> (eg. CLID_Hidd_Gfx )

And interface IDs like this.
IID_<system>_<interface name> (eg. IID_Hidd_Gfx )

Note that I'm here talking about
the name of a macro. The interface ID string
should be generated by some tool, and will not be
human-readable.
