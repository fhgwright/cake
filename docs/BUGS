assign DEVS: devs -> ok
list devs: -> ok
list devs:nil.handler -> "List: Object is of wrong type"
The problem was that list treated files as directories.

BUG000002 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
Workbench:> echo > test "Test"
Couldn't run command: Object not found
Workbench:> echo Test
Test
Workbench:>
The problem was the space between ">" and "test". ReadItem() would now
return "" for the filename and "test" as another parameter. Now I simply
skip the ">" or "<" before I allow ReadItem() to process the filename.

exec.library/RemTail() crashes on an empty list. It should return NULL.
I wouldn't be too surprised if RemHead() crashes, too. ('Crash' means:
Segmentation fault.)
The problem was that GetTail() didn't return NULL for an empty list.

BUG000004 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
The DosList structure found in AROS:include/dos/dosextens.h isn't
compatible to the original (Amiga) one. The biggest problem: dol_Name is a
STRPTR, but it should be a BSTR. (I wrote a program to show the currently
mounted devices, and it took me some time to find out why I got those silly
segfaults. BTW, the first DosList-entry has the name "(Null)", is this the
list-head or does it have any special meaning (i.e., is it a real device?)
dol_Name is now called dol_OldName and is still a BSTR. Additionally there is
now a field called dol_DevName, which is an ordinary STRPTR.

"mount devs:ram.handler RAM:" does nothing. Afterwards, no RAM: or RAM::
is available and no error is printed.

BUG000007 partial fix (doesn't crash anymore)
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
forkbomb cannot be called from the shell (one has to cut&paste one of
the lines of the script) and it runs only about 1000 times before it
GURUs with AN_MemCorrupt (81000005). Does not happen every time, though :-/

BUG000008 fixed

AROS crashes after some time with a GURU Meditation 8100 000e
Deadend/Exec/Stack appears to extend out of range
Task: 0x80765e8 (Idle task)
Either the problem is that the stack grows or the Task structure for the
idle task gets corrupted. Might be connected to BUG000007.

BUG000009 partial fix
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
demowin doesn't refresh correctly anymore since Moria3D bug has been
fixed. The initial REFRESH is not sent to the window.

It refreshes now more or less correctly but it sometimes hangs until one
moves the mouse :-/

This will be fixed as soon as the X Graphics HIDD is available.
Maybe connected to BUG000010.

BUG000010
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
Refresh doesn't work correctly or not at all if the window is resized.
This will be fixed as soon as the X Graphics HIDD is available.
Maybe connected to BUG000009.

icon.library crashes in readicon. Maybe due to new library header.

TestExampleLib creates corrupt memory. Maybe library is freed twice ?

BUG000013
srittau@aros.org
Moria3D segfaults with a fp exception while "Loading Fading..." on an
Intel (compatible) processors with internal FPU.
This is because you can't operate on floats anymore, maybe FPU has been
disabled.

BUG000014
klaus21@t-online.de
"dir :" does nothing.
The problem is that DoName() does not support a lock to the root directory of
a device. This is due to the fact that this functionality is missing in the
filehandler system.

BUG000015
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
After rtdemo, dir doesn't work anymore. I get "Object not found".
Changing dirs or using assigns causes segfaults. However, this only affects
the hd filesystem, you can change to RAM: where everything works okay.

Location of the bug:
The line file = Open("test.rtdemo",...) causes the error in the long run
because when removing this line verything seems to work alright.

BUG000016 partial fix
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
The path of the inital shell is wrong. Instead of "Workbench:" it
reads "Workbench:.". If you CD into a subdir (say libs), then
it doesn't change.
Still using the "cd" command the prompt does not change.

Demos/2View causes a Segmentation Fault before any output occurs.
The problem was that programs with mutiple object files must have $(STARTUP)
before $(OBJS) in mmakefile when linking

BUG000021

Demos/demowin kills the X server (on Linux/m68k) after correctly drawing the
windowcontents.

BUG000022
bergers@aros.org
After Demos/listfonts the next entry to the shell will cause a Segmentation 
Fault. The output of listfonts looks like garbage at some lines.

"I think that I found the error in the listfonts program. It is occuring in
ScanFontInfo (af_scanfontinfo.c) in line 74 at the call to CallHookPkt() if
idx=1, because if you put
if (1 == idx)
  return TRUE;
before that line everything works out alright and you'll be able to enter
commands to the shell. But if you put these two lines after the call to
CallHookPkt() you'll get the segmentation fault. Unfortunately I don't know
which code is executed by the call to CallHookPkt()."

BUG000024 fixed

The prompt of the shell does not show the complete path anymore, it just
shows the last subdirectory of the path (ie. "Workbench:Locale/Countries"
becomes "Countries"). This however is only on ffs_device, ram_device is okay.
Maybe related to BUG000016.

BUG000025

Seek() does not work properly: The position of the file only changes
to the new one if the current position is on EOF.

When using 2View, it prints multiple error-messages:

BUG000029 fixed

Henon started with "henon ?" should be recognized and the help-text

The problem was probably the buggy code in compiler/alib/startup.c.
