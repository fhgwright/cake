Short: AROS - Amiga Replacement OS

New this time:

- First small steps on graphics and intuition.library. You can open
    a window and render in it - Due to a bug, the rendering won't be
    visible every time. A small demo is there which open a window,
    renders something (sometimes) and then waits for a keypress.
- The includes and scripts were missing. They are here now.
- More things are generated now (function tables and prototypes)
- Some bug fixes.

This project's goal is to provide a public available AmigaOS which
is compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 (Kickstart 40.70) able to run on
other hardware than the Amiga (but on the Amiga also). The current
memberlist:

	Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (coordination)
	Matthias Fleischer (coding, ie. he's the one who works ;-) )
	Martin Steigerwald (port to Alpha and Sparc)
	Peter Boeckmann (coding some small functions)

and some 300 others (which are not mentioned here since they have not
written a line of code yet).

There are two archives which contain different things:

    AROSdev##.lha
    AROSbin##.lha

where ## is the version-number. The dev archive contains all files
neccessary to create bin and dev archives and to build/port the
complete tree. The bin Archive right now contains everything to test
AROS on Linux. Sorry, no Amiga port at this time.
