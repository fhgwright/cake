This accounts for Linux-m68k only!

You need version 2.0.29 of the Linux kernel sources to be sure 
that this works! In 2.1.42, for example, changes were made to
signal.c and entry.S in comparison with the files from 2.0.29.
 
In order to make the taskswitching possible you have to recompile  
Linux with some new files. Therefore you have to copy three files
from this directory to your Linux-sources:

signal.c and entry.S  to   arch/m68k/kernel
and
sigcontext.h          to   include/asm-m68k .
Now you have to compile Linux and after that restart it with the
new kernel.

In order to make AROS work, copy 
stackswap.c, coretest.c, entry.S to the parent directory
(this should be config/unix/exec).
Compile AROS and start it. It should work now!
