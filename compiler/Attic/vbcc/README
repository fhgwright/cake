This is a pre-alpha version of something which might become the compiler
for AROS. It contains untested, rudimentary support for i368 CPUs and
no Amiga specific constructs like #pragma and __asm.

The Copyright (C) is held by Volker Barthelmann, the author of VBCC and
not by AROS. Think of this as independent code.

Documentation for vbcc and a public version of it can be found on
AmiNet in dev/c/.

This version is *NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION*. It is no replacement for
vbcc*.lha which can be found on AmiNet.

Use at your own risk.
