vbcc - C compiler (c) in 1995-97 by Volker Barthelmann


INTRODUCTION

    vbcc is a free portable and retargetable ANSI C compiler.
    It is split into a target independant and a target dependant part and
    supports emulating datatypes of the target machine on any other machine
    so that it is possible to e.g. make a crosscompiler for a 64bit machine
    on a 32bit machine.

    This document only deals with building vbcc from the source.
    Be sure to read all the documents in the doc directory for your machine.


LEGAL

    vbcc is (c) in 1995-97 by Volker Barthelmann. The builtin preprocessor
    (consisting of the files preproc.c and vbpp.h) is written and (c) by
    Thorsten Schaaps. All other code is (c) by Volker Barthelmann.
    vbcc may be freely redistributed as long as no modifications are made
    and nothing is charged for it.
    Non-commercial usage of vbcc is allowed without any restrictions.
    Commercial usage needs my written consent.

    Sending me money, gifts, postcards etc. would of course be very nice
    and may encourage further development of vbcc, but is not legally or
    morally necessary to use vbcc.


DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE

    The vbcc-directory contains the following important files and
    directories:

    vbcc/                   The main directory.
    vbcc/Makefile           The Makefile used to build vbcc.
    vbcc/frontend/          Directory containing the source to vc.
    vbcc/vcpp/              Directory containing source to vcpp.
    vbcc/vsc/               Directory containing source to vsc.
    vbcc/machines/target/   Directory for <target>.              
    vbcc/bin/               Directory the executables will be placed.

    All compiling is done from the main directory.
    The preprocessor vcpp and the frontend vc are not target-dependant
    and therefore only one version of them is created.

    Every available target has at least one subdirectory with its name in
    vbcc/ and contains at least the files machine.h, machine.c and 
    machine.dt. Target-specific object-files will also be stored in that
    directory.

    The executables will be placed in vbcc/bin/. The main compiler will
    be called vbcc<target>.
