HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

There are two archives:

    AROSdev.lha
    AROS-$a-$b.lha

$a is the system and $b is the CPU this archive is for, ie.
AROS-linux-i386.lha is the binary archive for linux with Intel CPU (386 and
above), AROS-amiga.lha is the Amiga binary.

If you are not involved with developing AROS but want to try it out or
(even better) want to write apps for AROS, get the binary archive. It
contains a ready-to-use copy of all binaries for AROS (not that there
were many, yet ... :-). Unpack the archive, cd into AROS and run
the arosshell (NOTE: For some systeme, there are shared versions of the
libs to save disk space. On these systems, you must tell the loader to
look into AROS/lib for additional libs. On most systems, do "export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (without the "")).

Now you will get a prompt reading "Workbench:> ". Now type "dir all" and
press return and doesn't it look familiar (There will be lots of debugging
output which you can safely ignore. It will go away in the next versions) ?
Try "demowin" to see what our intuition.library and graphics.library can
do. Have you tried "sift" ? This is the AROS version of sift.c which is in
the RKRMs. We just copied and compiled it and it works ! If you want to try
it, copy any IFF file into the AROS directory and call sift with the
name of that file. It will print you the contents of the file using
iffparse.library !
