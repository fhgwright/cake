BUG00001
fseek() has a bug -- check in future

BUG00002 fixed
free_script() produces segfault when freeing a non-NULL first->arg
(which contains a valid string which can be printf()'ed )
TERROR! Always be sure to have enough space to save a string...
(I really need to think twice ;-)

BUG00003 fixed (see BUG00002)
When compiled -O2 instead of -O0 program segfaults when parsing file,
if I add a "printf(".");" in the first line of do{} loop, everything is ok
(on both -O0 and -O2) (This strange behaviour happens quite often:
adding a simple line with eg. printf() breaks working code, whereas it can
cure broken code as well)
Maybe connected to BUG00002

BUG00004
Strings are limited to MAXARGSIZE which is 1024 ATM.
