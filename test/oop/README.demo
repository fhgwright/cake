This OOP system is much like BOOPSI, but it uses
a hash table instead of switch().

This allows for some optimizations:
- Skipping unimplemented class calls.
- Obtaining single methods, and call the directly.

The demo shows how fast these two invocation methods
are compared to each other. This test is not
very much to go by though, because I don't have a large
class hierarchy (so methods are well spread through
the hash table in this demo).
