This might not seem like that big a deal,
but IMHO its nice to have some standard way
of naming attrs an methods.

Method/attr offsets.

Currently method and attr offsets are constructed like
this:

method offs:
<system>MIDX_<interface>_<method name>  (eg. MIDX_Timer_Start)

attr offs:
<system>AIDX_<interface>_<attrname>  (eg. AIDX_Timer_Elapsed)

However, this might lead to constructions
like HIDDAIDX_GfxHIDD_Pen
and HIDDMIDX_GfxHIDD_WritePixel
which is a bit ugly, so IMO we should
use the shortest possible prefix like this

<system>MO_<interface>_<method name> (HIDDMO_GfxHHIDD_WritePixel)
<system>AO_<interface>_<method name> (HIDDAO_GfxHIDD_Pen)

I suggest classnames like this:
CLID_<system>_<class name> (eg. CLID_HIDD_Gfx )

And interface IDs like this.
IID_<system>_<interface name> (eg. IID_HIDD_Gfx )

Note that I'm here talking about
the name of a macro. The interface ID string
should be generated by some tool, and will not be
human-readable.
