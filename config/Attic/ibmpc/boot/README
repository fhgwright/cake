Finally, the very first version of Native PC AROS. :-)))))

This is PRE-ALPHA version of Native PC AROS. I should rather call it PRE-ALPHA
bootloader. What do we have here? Look below.

bootsect.S	This is bootsector for floppy. Based on linux bootsect.S (sorry
		but in this code there is almost nothing to change...). I've
		written my own kernel loader. It's shorter than linux version.

setup.S		Again, based on linux. First it checks what CPU you have.
		setup continues only when 386 or better is detected.
		It detects drives, amount of memory, pointing device and
		32 bit APM BIOS. Then it sets up GDT and IDT tables for cpu,
		remaps IRQs. Then it resets fpu. After all initializations 
		it turns 32-bit protected mode on and jumps to the kernel
		at absolute address 0x00001000.

video.S		Again (;-)))) based on linux. Detects video card, halts in case
		of not having VGA or better. Then it sets 80x30 mode and stores
		all parameters (cursor pos and other things).

head.S		Name is based on linux ;-))). It is placed at abs addr 0x1000.
		Shortly - it sets everything up and calls main function written
		in C.

init.c		Nothing. Just contains main function. There will be AROS setup.

tools/build.c	Almost copy of linux's image builder. See linux sources for more
		comments.

How to make it work? Just go into this directory and type "make image" if you
want to get disk image, or put empty disk into first drive (fd0) and type
"make disk". Make will write image to disk. Now you can leave disk in floppy and
restart PC. If everything went OK Native PC AROS should be loaded. Screen
resolution will change and OS will halt - THIS IS EVERYTHING FOR NOW :-((((.

Wait 'till I write more code.

Or maybe you'll help me?
