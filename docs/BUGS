assign DEVS: devs -> ok
list devs: -> ok
list devs:nil.handler -> "List: Object is of wrong type"

BUG000002 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
Workbench:> echo > test "Test"
Couldn't run command: Object not found
Workbench:> echo Test
Test
Workbench:>
The problem was the space between ">" and "test". ReadItem() would now
return "" for the filename and "test" as another parameter. Now I simply
skip the ">" or "<" before I allow ReadItem() to process the filename.

BUG000003 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
exec.library/RemTail() crashes on an empty list. It should return NULL.
I wouldn't be too surprised if RemHead() crashes, too. ('Crash' means:
Segmentation fault.)
The problem was that GetTail() didn't return NULL for an empty list.

BUG000004
klaus21@t-online.de
The DosList structure found in AROS:include/dos/dosextens.h isn't
compatible to the original (Amiga) one. The biggest problem: dol_Name is a
STRPTR, but it should be a BSTR. (I wrote a program to show the currently
mounted devices, and it took me some time to find out why I got those silly
segfaults. BTW, the first DosList-entry has the name "(Null)", is this the
list-head or does it have any special meaning (i.e., is it a real device?)

BUG000005 fixed

BUG000006 fixed

"mount devs:ram.handler RAM:" does nothing. Afterwards, no RAM: or RAM::
is available and no error is printed.

"dir :" does nothing.

BUG000007
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
forkbomb cannot be called from the shell (one has to cut&paste one of
the lines of the script) and it runs only about 1000 times before it
GURUs with AN_MemCorrupt (81000005). Does not happen every time, though :-/

BUG000008
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
AROS crashes after some time with a GURU Meditation 8100 000e
Deadend/Exec/Stack appears to extend out of range
Task: 0x80765e8 (Idle task)
Either the problem is that the stack grows or the Task structure for the
idle task gets corrupted. Might be connected to BUG000007.
