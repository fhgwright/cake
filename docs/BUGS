BUG000001 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
assign DEVS: devs -> ok
list devs: -> ok
list devs:nil.handler -> "List: Object is of wrong type"
The problem was that list treated files as directories.

BUG000002 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
Workbench:> echo > test "Test"
Couldn't run command: Object not found
Workbench:> echo Test
Test
Workbench:>
The problem was the space between ">" and "test". ReadItem() would now
return "" for the filename and "test" as another parameter. Now I simply
skip the ">" or "<" before I allow ReadItem() to process the filename.

BUG000003 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
exec.library/RemTail() crashes on an empty list. It should return NULL.
I wouldn't be too surprised if RemHead() crashes, too. ('Crash' means:
Segmentation fault.)
The problem was that GetTail() didn't return NULL for an empty list.

BUG000004 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
The DosList structure found in AROS:include/dos/dosextens.h isn't
compatible to the original (Amiga) one. The biggest problem: dol_Name is a
STRPTR, but it should be a BSTR. (I wrote a program to show the currently
mounted devices, and it took me some time to find out why I got those silly
segfaults. BTW, the first DosList-entry has the name "(Null)", is this the
list-head or does it have any special meaning (i.e., is it a real device?)
dol_Name is now called dol_OldName and is still a BSTR. Additionally there is
now a field called dol_DevName, which is an ordinary STRPTR.

BUG000005 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de

BUG000006 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
"mount devs:ram.handler RAM:" does nothing. Afterwards, no RAM: or RAM::
is available and no error is printed.

BUG000007 partial fix (doesn't crash anymore)
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
forkbomb cannot be called from the shell (one has to cut&paste one of
the lines of the script) and it runs only about 1000 times before it
GURUs with AN_MemCorrupt (81000005). Does not happen every time, though :-/

BUG000008 fixed
digulla@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de
AROS crashes after some time with a GURU Meditation 8100 000e
Deadend/Exec/Stack appears to extend out of range
Task: 0x80765e8 (Idle task)
Either the problem is that the stack grows or the Task structure for the
idle task gets corrupted. Might be connected to BUG000007.

BUG000009 partial fix
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
demowin doesn't refresh correctly anymore since Moria3D bug has been
fixed. The initial REFRESH is not sent to the window.

It refreshes now more or less correctly but it sometimes hangs until one
moves the mouse :-/

BUG000010
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
Refresh doesn't work correctly or not at all if the window is resized.

BUG000011 fixed
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
icon.library crashes in readicon. Maybe due to new library header.

BUG000012
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
TestExampleLib creates corrupt memory. Maybe library is freed twice ?

BUG000013
srittau@aros.org
Moria3D segfaults with a fp exception while "Loading Fading..." on an
i486 with internal fpu.

BUG000014
klaus21@t-online.de
"dir :" does nothing.
The problem is that DoName() does not support a lock to the root directory of
a device. This is due to the fact that this functionality is missing in the
filehandler system.

BUG000015
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
After rtdemo, dir doesn't work anymore. I get "Object not found".

BUG000016 fixed
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
The path of the inital shell is wrong. Instead of "Workbench:" it
reads "Workbench:.". If you CD into a subdir (say libs), then
it doesn't change.

BUG000017
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
Local DOS-variables a not deallocated yet when the task is ending.

BUG000018
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
Devicetest cannot be linked correctly as there is no external Resident
structure found in a linkfile.

BUG000019
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
test/matchtest: when unlocking dirlock at the end of the program the dirlock 
should still exist and not create a GURU-Meditation saying that this memory 
has already been freed.

BUG000020
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
Demos/2View causes a Segmentation Fault before any output occurs.

BUG000021
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
Demos/demowin kills the X server (on Linux/m68k) after correctly drawing the
windowcontents.

BUG000022
bergers@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
After Demos/listfonts the next entry to the shell will cause a Segmentation 
Fault. The output of listfonts looks like garbage at some lines.

BUG000023
berger@cip.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de
Demos/sift crashes with a GURU-Meditation saying that memory was
freed twice.

BUG000024
hkiel@aros.org fixed
The prompt of the shell does not show the complete path anymore, it just
shows the last subdirectory of the path (ie. "Workbench:Locale/Countries"
becomes "Countries"). This however is only on ffs_device, ram_device is okay.
Maybe related to BUG000016.
