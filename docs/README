Short: AROS - Amiga Replacement OS
Author:   Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (digulla@fh-konstanz.de) and many others

Version:  1.5
Type:	  misc/emu

New this time:

- Everything changed :) Throw away the 1.4 and below.
- Most of Exec and much of DOS
- A shell is available and some 10 commands to test it (like Dir, List,
    Echo, etc).
- CVS is used to allow multiple people to work on this at the same
    time. Look into README.CVS for how to participate.

This project's goal is to provide a public available AmigaOS which
is compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 (Kickstart 40.70) able to run on
other hardware than the Amiga (but on the Amiga also). The current
memberlist:

	Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (coordination)
	Matthias Fleischer (coding, ie. he's the one who works ;-) )

and some 300 others (which are not mentioned here since they have not
written a line of code yet).

There are two archives which contain different things:

    AROSdev##.lha
    AROSbin##.lha

where ## is the version-number. The dev archive contains all files
neccessary to create bin and dev archives and to build/port the
complete tree. The bin Archive right now contains everything to test
AROS on Linux. Sorry, no Amiga port at this time.
