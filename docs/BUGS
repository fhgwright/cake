BUG000003

exec.library/RemTail() crashes on an empty list. It should return NULL.
I wouldn't be too surprised if RemHead() crashes, too. ('Crash' means:
Segmentation fault.)

BUG000004
klaus21@t-online.de
The DosList structure found in AROS:include/dos/dosextens.h isn't
compatible
to the original (Amiga) one. The biggest problem: dol_Name is a STRPTR,
but
it should be a BSTR.
(I wrote a program to show the currently mounted devices, and it took me
some
time to find out why I got those silly segfaults. BTW, the first
DosList-entry has
the name "(Null)", is this the list-head or does it have any special
meaning (i.e.,
is it a real device?)
