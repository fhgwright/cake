This accounts for Linux-m68k only!

In order to make the taskswitching possible you have to recompile  
Linux with some new files. Therefore you have to copy three files
in this directory to your Linux-sources:

signal.c and entry.S  to   arch/m68k/kernel
and
sigcontext.h          to   include/asm-m68k .
Now you have to compile Linux and after that restart it with the
new kernel.

In order to make AROS work copy 
stackswap.c, coretest.c, entry.S to the parent directory
(this should be config/unix/exec).
Compile AROS and start it. It should work now!
