This directory contains functions which are self contained. If you
want to add a function FuncName, you must supply this:

    - A file funcname.h which defines

	- COMMONLIB_FUNCNAME_H when it is read
	- an inline function or macro FuncName if CommonLib_NoInline
	  is *not* defined
	- a normal function if CommonLib_NoInline is defined.

    - A file funcname.c with a main() function which tests the
      macros and functions defined in funcname.h. The file must
      compile with GCC and it must test both the inline and the
      normal function.
