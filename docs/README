Short: AROS - Amiga Replacement OS
Author:   Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (digulla@fh-konstanz.de) and many others
Uploader: Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (digulla@fh-konstanz.de)
Version:  1.9
Type:	  misc/emu

New this time:
- Real preemptive multitasking like on Amiga
- Many files were missing in the dev distribution :-(
- Some bugfixes
- FreeBSD/i386 support
- Amiga users can now participate. Read README.CVS for more info.
- Even more easy to port to a new hardware
- HTML docs

This project's goal is to provide a public available AmigaOS which
is compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 (Kickstart 40.70) able to run on
other hardware than the Amiga (but on the Amiga also). The current
memberlist:

	Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla (coordination)
	Matthias Fleischer (coding, ie. he's the one who works ;-) )
	Martin Steigerwald (port to Alpha and Sparc)
	Peter Boeckmann (coding some small functions)
	Iain Templeton (FreeBSD port and utility.library)
	Lennard voor den Dag (Amiga port - at last :-)

and some 300 others (which are not mentioned here since they have not
written a line of code yet).

!!! IMPORTANT: TO USE AROS IN THE CURRENT FORM, YOU MUST HAVE LINUX ON A
PC WITH INTEL CPU (eg. 386, 486, Pentium) AND X11R6 !!!

There are two archives which contain different things:

    AROSdev##.lha
    AROSbin##.lha

where ## is the version-number. The dev archive contains all files
neccessary to create bin and dev archives and to build/port the
complete tree. The bin Archive right now contains everything to test
AROS on Linux, ie. it contains an executable which simulates an Amiga
and some binaries to test it (Dir, List, Echo, LibraryTest and OpenWin).
Sorry, no Amiga port at this time.

If you want to contribute, read README.CVS. Right now, you need access
to a Unix site to do this (or a friend you trust) to generate a password.
