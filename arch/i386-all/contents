init.c - This file contains the real |main()| and sets
	up all libraries, devices and all other stuff which
	must be known before the first user process can
	begin to work.

machine.h - Constants which allow Exec to adjust to
	the local hardware.

makefile - This is a good example of how
	sub-makefiles for AROS should look like.
